Configuration
=============


This section is dedicated to the configuration of Stay In Tarkov. If you haven't installed Stay In Tarkov yet, click :ref:`here <install>`.

Network Configuration
---------------------

Follow this section if you're planning to be the coop game host (server). At least one person in your group needs to follow
this process to be able to play coop together. The person with the best computer and network performance should be the
host for a better experience. Don't let the lad with 10kbps internet host please.

UPnP
~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is the **preferred** method for server hosting as it supports automagically opening 
   the ports that SIT needs while they are needed. However this only works for competent routers (looking at you USA).
   If you have issues with this please follow the :ref:`Port Forwarding<portforward>` guide below for manually opening the required ports for |SIT|.

   If you are using UPnP, skip to :ref:`HTTP JSON Configuration <httpjson>` to prep the server
.. _portforward:

Port forwarding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   Port forwarding is the process of opening a port on your external IP address and redirect the traffic to a specific 
   device. The process is different for all router models. Therefore, we cannot provide a step-by-step tutorial for 
   port forwarding.

   If you are unsure how to port forward, google "YOUR_ROUTER_MODEL port forward" or contact your Internet Service Provider.
   
   **An example has been provided below but we cannot support you on this because every router is wildly different so please try
   to find instructions for your specific router.**

Here is a quick example on how to port forward with a Virgin Media Superhub 3 (UK)

1. Open ``cmd`` and type ``ipconfig``
2. Find ``Default Gateway:`` it should have an IP similar to ``192.168.0.1``. Also note down your local IP ``IPv4 Address``
3. Open your web browser and type the ``Default Gateway`` IP into the URL bar (Not the search bar)
4. There may be a login page there, put in the login details so you can get to the main dashboard
5. You will need to look for a tab called "Port Forwarding". It may be under some advanced settings or security tab

6. Once in there you should be able to open certain ports to certain IPs. This is where the ``IPv4 Address`` comes in
7. Open ports 6969 to 6972, making sure to include those two as well, so 4 total ports. Some routers can port a range, if you can't you'll have to do them 1 by 1

8. Make sure to use the "Both" option for Protocal if you can, otherwise you will need to do it twice, for both UDP and TCP
9. Once you save that those ports should now be open, and pointing traffic to your PC
10. Once you have completed these steps go :ref:`here <httpjson>` to configure the server to use these ports

.. warning::
   Not all Internet Service Provider allows port forwarding. Sometimes port forwarding is blocked at the provider level or
   at the router level. In any case, the person able to port forward should be the host, provided their computer and network 
   is capable.

   If that is the case, you may have to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) like Hamachi, Radmin or ZeroTier to allow people to connect
   however these may come with performance hits to players ping due to how they work. Port fowarding is the prefered method.


Virtual Private Network (VPN)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   Virtual private network such as Hamachi, Radmin or ZeroTier allows to create an internet-based "local" network. All traffic 
   will be transmitted through the internet and redirected to a virtual network adapter which acts as a local network. This is 
   useful for those which are unable to port forward. However, performance is not as good as port forwarding because 
   traffic must go through a third party service.

   If you need help setting these up a basic guide will be provided however we cannot help with issues coming from using these,
   so it may be best to look up a guide on how to use them beforehand.

.. warning::
   We do not recommend using VPN to play Stay In Tarkov because they are known to have rate limitations and hinder network
   performance and stability. SIT is not well optimized and transmit a lot of data to synchronize information between players.
   
   **Use at your own risk.**

      <summary>Hamachi Configuration</summary>

#. Install hamachi from their offical site here `Hamachi <https://vpn.net/>`_
#. Click the power button, it should ask you to log in, either log in or register an account to continue
#. If you are joining a server, join the hosts Hamachi network by pressing "Join an Existing Network" and enter the ID and Password
   
   * If you are hosting the server, press "Create a New Network", then give it a name and password, give this to everyone you are playing with

#. Once you are all in the network, make sure everyones light is green, if not, look up a guide to fix it, we **CANNOT** help with this.
#. If everyone is connected and with green light, go :ref:`HTTP JSON Config<httpjson>` to setup the server to use the VPN

      <summary>Radmin Configuration</summary>

#. Install Radmin from their offical site here `Radmin <https://www.radmin-vpn.com/>`_
#. Once installed, make sure the power button icon says "On" and has an IP below your Computer Name. We cannot help with errors on this
#. If you are joining a server, join the hosts Radmin network by pressing "Join Network" and enter the ID and Password
   
   * If you are hosting the server, press "Create Network", then give it a name and password, give this to everyone you are playing with

#. If the bar is green, the connection has been successful and you're ready to continue, if not, then you'll need to look up your issue as we can't help
#. Once this has been done, head to :ref:`HTTP JSON Config<httpjson>` to setup the server to use the VPN

.. _httpjson:

HTTP JSON file configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open ``SIT\Server\Aki_Data\Server\configs\http.json`` with your preferred text text editor.
#. Locate the "ip" parameter. You should see a default value of "127.0.0.1".
#. Change "127.0.0.1" with ``0.0.0.0``. (Only change from ``0.0.0.0`` if you know what you're doing)
#. Save your changes and close the text editor.
#. Once you have done this, head :ref:`here <serverplay>` and follow the Server steps to see how to launch and join the server

.. _firewall:

Firewall Configuration
----------------------

.. note:: 
   This section is about configuring your Windows firewall to allow the clients to connect to the server through your PC, although you have forwarded the ports
   your PC itself my still reject the connections because it hasn't been configured to allow them, the below section will detail how to do that if
   the server hasn't already asked to be allowed through

General Configuration
----------------------------

Below are steps for configuring both the |SIT| client and the |SIT| Server, this have been split into catagories for your :strike:`pleasure` convience.

.. _clientconf:

Client Side Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   The configs for your client are located in ``SIT\Game\BepInEx\config\com.stayintarkov.cfg``. You may want to use a text editor that isn't
   the built in notepad, something like VSCode, or at least Notepad++

   These settings will only take effect if the person that has modified them is hosting the raid, so settings like ``EnableAISpawnWaveSystem``
   will only take effect if the person that modified them hosts.

.. warning:: 
   **DO NOT** edit any of the ``Enabled`` options as they are for debug purposes and **SHOULD NOT** be modified in any way.

.. _serverconf:

Server Side Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   The configs for your client are located in ``SIT\Server\user\mods\SITCoop\config\SITConfig.json``. You may want to use a text editor that isn't
   the built in notepad, something like VSCode, or at least Notepad++

   These settings are changed on the Aki server config, so they affect every player on the server, wether they host the raid or are
   just a client.
